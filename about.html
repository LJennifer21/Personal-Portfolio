    <h1 > Hello There! </h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      My name is Jennifer Lucero. I'm a Computer Science student at San Jose State University and the first in my family to attend University.
    

      <br>
      <br>

    
      My curiosity for technology began early, especially when I was introduced to block coding—my first experience with programming. Since then, I've been eager to continue growing my skills, particularly in HTML/CSS.
  
      <br>
      <br>
   

    
      As a member of the Girls Who Code Club at SJSU, I was able to expand my knowledge of different coding languages and utilize them to make my own future projects/creations. As a continuing member, I express a passion for learning new things and exploring my tech journey beyond the classroom.
    

   <br>
   <br>

    
      You can often find me in school studying for my classes or practicing my coding skills—always striving to improve and stay curious on my journey in tech.
