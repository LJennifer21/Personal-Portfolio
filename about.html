  <p style="text-align: left;" > My name is Jennifer Lucero. I'm a Computer Science student at San Jose State University and the first in my family to attend University. </p>
  <br>
  <p style="text-align: left;" > My curiosity for technology began early, especially whem I was introduced to black coding—my first experience with programming. Since then, I've been eager to continue growing my skills, particularly in HTML/CSS.
 <br>
  <br>
  <p style="text-align: left;" >As a member of the Girls Who Code Club at SJSU, I was able to expand my knowledge of different coding languages and utilze them to make my own future projects/creations. As a contiuning member, I express a passion of learning new things and exploring my tech journey beyond the classroom.</p>

  <br>
  <p style="text-align: left;" >You can often find me in school studying for my classes or practing on my coding skills—always striving to improve and stay curious on my journey in tech.</p>
